# Urban-Sound-Classification-with-Neural-Networks
Python
The goal of this project is to build a neural network to classify audio files from the UrbanSound8k dataset
This dataset contains audio divided in ten classes, each one representing a different type of city sound, for instance, we can find car horns, dogs barking, sirens,
etc.
