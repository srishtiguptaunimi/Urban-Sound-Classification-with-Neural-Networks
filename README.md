## Project Description
Urban environments are filled with diverse sounds that contribute to the overall atmosphere. This project aims to classify these sounds using a neural network trained on a dataset of urban audio recordings. The model is designed to recognize specific sound categories, which can be useful in various applications, such as smart city monitoring, environmental sound analysis, and enhancing user experiences in urban settings.The UrbanSound8k dataset can be downloaded at https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html

## Data
The dataset used for this project consists of audio recordings categorized into **eight different classes** of urban sounds:
1. **Air Conditioner**: Sounds from air conditioning units.
2. **Car Horn**: Sounds from vehicle horns.
3. **Children Playing**: Sounds from children in play.
4. **Dog Barking**: Sounds made by barking dogs.
5. **Drilling**: Noises from drilling equipment.
6. **Gun Shot**: Sounds resembling gunfire.
7. **Jackhammer**: Noises produced by jackhammers.
8. **Siren**: Sounds from emergency vehicle sirens.

The audio files are typically in WAV format and are organized into subdirectories based on their respective classes.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
1. To develop a convolutional neural network capable of classifying urban sounds.
2. To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance in terms of accuracy and loss metrics.
3. To explore the impact of different preprocessing techniques on model performance.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation
The data preparation process involves several key steps:
- **Audio Preprocessing**: Audio files are converted into spectrograms or mel-spectrograms, which serve as visual representations of sound frequencies over time.
- **Normalization**: The audio data is normalized to ensure consistent input values for the neural network.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques such as time stretching and pitch shifting are applied to increase dataset diversity and improve model robustness.

### Model Architecture
The architecture of the convolutional neural network includes:
- **Input Layer**: Accepts preprocessed spectrogram images.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Multiple layers that apply filters to extract features from the spectrograms.
- **Pooling Layers**: Max pooling layers reduce dimensionality while retaining essential features.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Dense layers interpret the features extracted by convolutional layers and produce final classifications.

### Training Process
The training process consists of:
1. **Loss Function**: Categorical crossentropy is used as the loss function to measure how well the model predicts the class labels.
2. **Optimizer**: The Adam optimizer is employed for efficient weight updates during training.
3. **Training Loop**: The model is trained over multiple epochs with validation on a separate dataset to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.

## Results
The trained model demonstrates significant accuracy in classifying urban sounds:
- **Accuracy Metrics**: The model achieves high accuracy on both training and validation datasets.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is generated to visualize classification performance across different classes.

## Conclusion
This project successfully illustrates how convolutional neural networks can be applied to audio classification tasks within the context of urban sounds. The results indicate that deep learning models can effectively learn from audio data, providing valuable insights for applications in smart city initiatives and environmental monitoring.

## Future Work
Future enhancements could include:
- Expanding the dataset with more diverse examples to improve generalization across different urban environments.
- Implementing real-time sound classification using live audio input from microphones or smart devices.
- Exploring advanced architectures or techniques such as transfer learning with pre-trained models for improved performance.

This repository serves as an educational resource for those interested in machine learning applications in audio processing and provides practical insights into building audio classification models using deep learning techniques.
